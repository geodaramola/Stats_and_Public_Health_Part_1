Statistics & Public Health 1: Cleaning and EDA
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

You are given mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019.

In this deliverable, you will perform basic EDA and data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset from the city of Chicago.
